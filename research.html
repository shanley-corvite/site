            <h1>Research.</h1>
            <br>
            <p> When I entered college, I learned that a major passion of mine is research. 
                I’ve been blessed with numerous opportunities that have allowed me to explore research in different fields. 
                I work closely with projects inside and outside of the University of Michigan where I investigate the following research areas:

                At the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan's School of Information</a>, I work closely with Assistant Professor, <a href="http://oliverhaimson.com/">Dr. Oliver L. Haimson</a> and other students on the Life Transitions and Social Technologies project.
                This project focuses on various life transitions and how social technologies help people facilitate those experiences of major change.

                During the Summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to join the <a href="http://www.i3-inclusion.org/">iSchool Inclusion Institute (i3)</a>, a program that gives students research and leadership development experience. 
                i3 prepares students from underrepresented populations for graduate study and careers in the information sciences. 
                I work closely with <a href="https://uci.academia.edu/DanielLowellGardner">Ph.D Candidate Daniel L. Gardner</a> from University of California-Irvine along with other students from all over the world. 
                We focus on what representations of race are currently on video game covers, how they are perceived by potential players, and what the implications of these perceptions are.
