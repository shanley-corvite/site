            <h1>High School Robotics.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>           
            From my sophomore to senior year at Muchin College Prep High School, I participated in the Robotics Club. 
            The Robotics Club focused on underwater robotics competitions. 
            As one of the founding members of the club, I held the position of Project Manager in which my responsibilities were to 
            create the required documentations, provide tasks to other team members, look for funding opportunities, take inventory of our materials, and ensure we were prepared for competitions.

                As project manager, one of my main tasks were to create the necessary documentations for competition.

            <p>
                The M.U.S.E. team's technical documentation entails the process of creating our underwater robot. 
                It specifies the safety measures we took and safety features of our remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the design process, budget and project costing, the system interconnection diagram, and challenges we faced.

            <p>
                The competition requires the team to create a poster that encases how we addressed the challenge of the competition, the design rationale of our ROV, and an assessment of the marketing of our ROV.

            <p>
                As part of the competition, we needed to host an outreach event. 
                Part of the robotics team went to an elementary school in the southside of Chicago where members gave a presentation about the STEM field and taught students how to solder.
                We wanted to advertise our outreach event through a flyer that displayed the work we did with the students.
